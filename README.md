<a href="https://github.com/lcdlima/python_projects/blob/master/guess_the_number.py">Guess The Number</a>: The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

<a href="https://github.com/lcdlima/python_projects/blob/master/guess_the_number.py">Guess The Number</a>: The user needs to guess what that number is. If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

Simple Sum: Read two integer values, in this case for variables A and B. Then, calculate the sum between them and assign to the variable SUM. Then write the value of this variable.

Simple Product: Read two integer values. Next, calculate the product between these two values and assign this operation to the PROD variable. Then show the PROD variable with corresponding message.

Average 1: Read 2 double-precision floating point values A and B, which correspond to 2 grades of a student. Next, calculate the student's average, knowing that grade A has a weight of 3.5 and grade B has a weight of 7.5 (The sum of the weights is therefore 11). Assume that each note can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.

Average 2: Read 3 values, in this case, variables A, B and C, which are the three grades of a student. Next, calculate the student's average, knowing that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can range from 0 to 10.0, always to one decimal place.

Difference: Read four integer values A, B, C and D. Next, calculate and show the difference of the product of A and B by the product of C and D according to the formula: DIFFERENCE = (A * B - C * D).

Salary: Write a program that reads an employee's number, his number of hours worked, the amount he receives per hour and calculates that employee's salary. Next, show the employee's number and salary, to two decimal places.

Salary With Bonus: Make a program that reads the name of a salesman, his fixed salary and the total sales made by him in the month (in cash). Knowing that this seller earns 15% commission on his sales made, inform the total receivable at the end of the month, with two decimal places.

Simple Calculation: In this problem, you should read the code of a part 1, the number of parts 1, the unit value of each part 1, the code of a part 2, the number of parts 2 and the unit value of each part 2. After , calculate and show the amount to be paid.

Sphere: Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere and the value of its radius (R) is given. The formula for calculating the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) to pi the value 3.14159. Tip: When using the formula, try to use (4 / 3.0) or (4.0 / 3), because some languages (among them C ++), assume that the result of the division between two integers is another integer.

Area: Write a program that reads three double-precision floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show:
a) the area of the right triangle with A as the base and C as the height.
b) the area of the circle of radius C. (pi = 3.14159)
c) the area of the trapezoid that has A and B for bases and C for height.
d) the area of the square with side B.
e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.

The Biggest: Make a program that reads three values and displays the largest of the three values read in a row.

Consumption: Calculate the average consumption of a car by supplying the total distance traveled (in km) and the total fuel spent (in liters).

Distance Between Two Points: Read the four values corresponding to the x and y axes of any two points in the plane, p1 (x1, y1) and p2 (x2, y2) and calculate the distance between them, showing 4 decimal places after the comma.

Distance: Two cars (X and Y) leave in the same direction. Car X leaves at a constant speed of 60 km / h and car Y leaves at a constant speed of 90 km / h. In one hour (60 minutes), car Y is able to distance itself 30 kilometers from car X, that is, it is able to move one kilometer away every 2 minutes. Read the distance (in Km) and calculate how long it takes (in minutes) for car Y to take that distance from the other car.

Fuel: Joãozinho wants to calculate and show the amount of liters of fuel spent on a trip, when using a car that does 12 KM / L. For this, I would like you to attend to it through a simple program. To perform the calculation, the time spent on the trip (in hours) and the average speed during the trip (in km / h) must be reported. Thus, one can obtain the distance covered and calculate how many liters would be needed. Show the value to 3 decimal places after the period.

Banknotes: Read an integer value. Next, calculate the smallest possible number of notes (banknotes) into which the value can be broken down. The notes considered are 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1. Next, show the value read and the list of necessary notes.

Time Conversion: Read an integer value, which is the duration in seconds of a given event in a factory, and enter it in the format hours: minutes: seconds.

Age in Days: Read an integer corresponding to a person's age in days and enter it in years, months and days. Note: just to facilitate the calculation, consider every year with 365 days and every month with 30 days. In test cases there will never be a situation that allows 12 months and some days, such as 360, 363 or 364. This is just an exercise with the aim of testing simple mathematical reasoning.

Banknotes and Coins: Read a floating point value to two decimal places. This value represents a monetary value. Next, calculate the smallest number of notes and coins possible into which the value can be broken down. The notes considered are 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2. The possible currencies are 1, 0.50, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01. Then show the list of notes required.

Selection Test: Read 4 integer values A, B, C and D. Next, if B is greater than C and if D is greater than A, and the sum of C with D is greater than the sum of A and B and if C and D, both are positive and if variable A is to write the message "Values accepted", otherwise write "Values not accepted".

Bhaskara: Read 3 floating point values and calculate the roots of the Bhaskara equation. If it is not possible to calculate the roots, display the corresponding message “Impossible to calculate”, in case there is a division by 0 or negative number root.

Interval: You must make a program that reads any value and presents a message saying in which of the following intervals ([0.25], (25.50], (50.75], (75.100]) this value is found. the value is not in any of these ranges, the message “Out of range” should be printed. The symbol (represents "greater than". For example: [0.25] indicates values between 0 and 25.0000, including them. (25.50] indicates values greater than 25 Ex: 25.00001 up to the value 50.0000000.

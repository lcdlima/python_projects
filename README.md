<a href="https://github.com/lcdlima/python_projects/blob/master/guess_the_number.py">Guess The Number</a>: The user needs to guess what that number is. If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

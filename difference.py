# Read four integer values A, B, C and D. Next, calculate and show the difference of the product of A and B by the product of C and D according to the formula: DIFFERENCE = (A * B - C * D).

A = int (input ())

B = int (input ())

C = int (input ())

D = int (input ())

DIFERENCA = (A*B - C*D)

print ('DIFERENCA = {}'. format (DIFERENCA))
